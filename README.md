# HINTS
R code to replicate results from the Health Information National Trends Survey ([HINTS](https://hints.cancer.gov/)) conducted by the National Cancer Institute. Code replicates results from [HINTS 5, Cycle 3](https://hints.cancer.gov/data/download-data.aspx).

Scripts `hints.sas` and `hints.R` replicate results from [HINTS 5, Cycle 3](https://hints.cancer.gov/data/download-data.aspx).

Scripts `HINTS-merge5.sas` and `HINTS-merge5.R` merge all three cycles of HINTS 5 into a single survey. Example results from the merged data are in `HINTS-merge5.html` (R)  `no-differences_xlsx` and `with_differences_xlsx` (SAS).
