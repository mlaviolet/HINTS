# Applications of the HINTS survey using R
R code to replicate results from the Health Information National Trends Survey ([HINTS](https://hints.cancer.gov/)) conducted by the National Cancer Institute. Scripts `hints.sas` and `hints.R` replicate results from _Overview of the HINTS 5 Cycle 3 Survey and Data Analysis Recommendations_, contained in the ZIP files found [here](https://hints.cancer.gov/data/download-data.aspx).

Scripts `HINTS-merge5.R` and `HINTS-merge5.sas` merge all three cycles of HINTS 5 into a single survey. Example results from the merged data are found in `HINTS-merge5.html` (R),  `no-differences.xlsx`, and `with_differences.xlsx` (SAS).
